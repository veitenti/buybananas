help-purpose = This app helps you to organize your shopping. You are already carrying a smart phone with you, why not let it help you with your shopping in a more "smart" way than a piece of paper could? Some of the features are suggestions based on your previous purchases, suggestions based on seasonal products, shopping statistics and the ability to learn where which product is placed in the shops you are visiting regularly to sort your shopping list accordingly, so you don't have to read through the whole list every few meters to check if you are not missing something there.

This includes products you buy on a regular basis (e.g. toothpaste, toilet paper or simply salt and pepper) as well as vegetables and fruits that are in season right now.
