# README

Tiny shopping list app written mostly for myself from university times. The app was written with the goal to learn new technologies and tools.

## Features

The app can organize items in a shopping list according to the order in which they appear in store so you don't need to scroll through the whole list every corner of your supermarket to make sure you don't forget anything and have to come back for it later. This behaviour is learned from the order in which items are checked of over time (by category).

Items bought regularly are suggested after a certain amount of time has passed. For example if you buy toothpaste every 2 months the app would suggest adding toothpaste to the list a bit earlier than necessary.

Additionally there are charts included that show how many items are bought per category.
